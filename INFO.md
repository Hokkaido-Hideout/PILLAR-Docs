The Procedural Pillars Generator is a lightweight, editor-focused tool for rapidly producing customizable pillar meshes directly inside Unreal Engine. It’s designed as a practical helper for level blockouts, prototyping, and supporting/background environment art—especially when you just need clean, low-poly geometry fast.



This is experimental technology, not a substitute for a trained 3D artist. It won’t give you hero assets or production-grade sculpted detail. What it will give you is immediate structural forms you can iterate on without leaving the editor, ideal for early-phase environment layout, worldbuilding tests, and filling out spaces that don’t justify full asset authoring.



You can adjust profile, height, taper, segmentation, beveling, and surface variation with simple parameters. Generate variations, test compositions, and export results as normal Static Mesh assets when ready.





Best Use Cases

• Rapid blockout and level layout

• Background/secondary pillars for low-poly or stylized scenes

• Quick environmental prototypes for indie and solo dev pipelines

• Support geometry that doesn’t require manual modeling time





Not a Replacement For

• High-fidelity sculpted pillars

• Hero assets or centerpiece structures

• Complex architectural detailing





If your workflow needs fast geometry, clean variations, and on-the-spot iteration, this generator earns its keep. It keeps teams moving, keeps prototypes flexible, and keeps you focused on what matters: building your world, not bouncing between tools.
